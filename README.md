## Project Overview

This was a Mod 2 project from Turing School of Software and Design. The goals were aimed towards getting experience with new concepts such as: Webpack, SCSS, jQuery, and webAPIs.

## Goals
* Build on top of pre-existing code that you did not write and navigate someone elseâ€™s codebase
* Develop processes for working remotely and submitting pull requests to perform effective code reviews that help ensure the code is accurate and that everyone understands it
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Refactor pre-existing code and use inheritance to DRY up repetitive logic
* Ensure our app is following best practices for accessibility
* Leverage Sass to DRY up your CSS
* Incorporate Webpack to streamline your workflow process
* Leverage Chai Spies to verify that your DOM manipulation is happening

## Technologies And Tools
> * JavaScript
> * HTML
> * CSS/SASS/SCSS
> * Chai Spies
> * Webpack
> * eslint
> * Lighthouse Audits
> * git
> * GitHub
> * Terminal

* *Click* the **Fork** button on the top right-hand corner of this page
* Clone the repository down and cd into the repo on your local machine by running:
  * `git clone git@github.com:mdflynn/refactor-tractor-fitlit.git`
  * `cd refactor-tractor-fitlit`
* Install the library dependencies by running:
  * `npm install`
* To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal.
* Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the site.
* Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
</details>

## Challenges
* Refactoring and understanding someone else's code
* Utilizing GitHub Project board to organize work
* Refactoring to use class inheritance
* New SASS syntax
* Understanding how to use Chai Spies to test DOM manipulation

## Wins
* Success with atomic commits
* Good group communication and time scheduling
* Using issues with in conjunction with PR requests
* Consistency with PR templates
* Balance of work between group members
* Successful with self-teaching new tools

## Roadmap
* With more time, we would like improve the UI and UX for a better user experience
* Add a calendar option for the user to select dates for entering relative information
* Ability to create new account/user
* Add more sad path testing
